# File Management Toolkit
### Project Description:

This repository hosts a collection of Python scripts designed to streamline file organization, management, and transformation tasks. Tailored for efficiency and ease of use, this toolkit addresses common file handling needs such as renaming, sorting, and converting file formats, as well as offering utilities for file encryption and log analysis. Each script in this collection is standalone, allowing users to deploy them individually based on their specific requirements.

### Features:

- Bulk Archiver: Tool that allows for comprehensive archiving while excluding certain file types.
- Selective Archiver: Tool for targeted approach for archiving, letting you focus on specific file types while excluding others.
- Analysis Tool: Provides functions like File Count Analyser, Disk Space Analyser, File Type Distribution Analyser and Large File Finder.
- Batch File Renamer: Automatically renames files in a directory based on customizable criteria (date, type, custom pattern).
- Duplicate File Finder: Scans directories to identify and handle duplicate files, aiding in decluttering and optimizing storage space.
- Directory Organizer: Sorts files into categorized folders based on type, name (regex), or date.
- Automated Backup Utility: Performs regular backups of designated directories to local or cloud storage.
- Bulk Image Resizer: Resizes multiple images simultaneously, ideal for web development and digital media management.
- File Encryption/Decryption: Provides added security for sensitive documents through encryption and decryption capabilities.
- Multi-Clipboard: This utility is for seamlessly saving and retrieving text snippets to and from the clipboard, enhancing productivity with simple command-line interactions.


Each script is self-contained and documented with instructions on usage and requirements. Clone the repository, install `requirements.txt` and navigate to the script that fits your task. Scripts are designed to be user-friendly, requiring minimal setup.

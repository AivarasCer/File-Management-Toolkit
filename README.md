# File Management Toolkit
### Project Description:

This repository hosts a collection of Python scripts designed to streamline file organization, management, and transformation tasks. Tailored for efficiency and ease of use, this toolkit addresses common file handling needs such as renaming, sorting, and converting file formats, as well as offering utilities for file encryption and log analysis. Each script in this collection is standalone, allowing users to deploy them individually based on their specific requirements.

### Key Features:

Batch File Renamer: Automatically renames files in a directory based on customizable criteria (date, type, custom pattern).
Duplicate File Finder: Scans directories to identify and handle duplicate files, aiding in decluttering and optimizing storage space.
File Format Converter: Converts files between various formats (e.g., image, text, audio) with support for batch processing.
Directory Organizer: Sorts files into categorized folders based on type, name, or other attributes.
Automated Backup Utility: Performs regular backups of designated directories to local or cloud storage.
Bulk Image Resizer: Resizes multiple images simultaneously, ideal for web development and digital media management.
Metadata Editor: Edits or strips metadata from files, particularly useful for images and PDFs.
File Encryption/Decryption: Provides added security for sensitive documents through encryption and decryption capabilities.
Log File Analyzer: Parses log files to extract and report critical information, aiding in system monitoring and troubleshooting.
Automated Data Report Generator: Compiles data from various files into comprehensive reports.
Getting Started:

Each script is self-contained and documented with instructions on usage and requirements. Clone the repository, and navigate to the script that fits your task. Scripts are designed to be user-friendly, requiring minimal setup.
